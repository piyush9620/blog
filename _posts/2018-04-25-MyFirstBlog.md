title: My First Ever Blogpost
---
Hello World! This is my first ever blog post. I have been selected for Google Summer Of Codes 2018 and would be spending my summer coding for OpenMRS. I have decided to blog on weekly basis once the coding phase starts from May 14th onwards and also when I have something to share. Experience this journey with me by continuing to read my future posts. Thanks!
